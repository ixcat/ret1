# misc moveout #2:
# - foreign key w/r/t insert1:
#   either my usage is dumb, or this could potentially be parameterized
#   e.g. insert1_fkey(fkey1,fkey2,... rest ...)
#   saves having to resolve in depth and manually build query in client code
#   however, with consistent data, can simply populate;
#   however, not all files will have all data, so this still could be useful..
# - big idea: ETL loader tool - but this is huge effort.
#   e.g config:
#   - match: /[]/[tblname]/[field1,field]
#   - parms:
#     - tblname: 1:1
#     - field: 1:M
#   or somesuch..
# misc moveout:
# - docs have 'databas.password' in creating a schema section
# - verify: is there clear note that ipython is required for
#   the 'pretty printing' e.g. '>>> mouse -> {fields, ... }'
# - matlab .mat array fun in python might be good add'l docs or lib even
#   though perhaps is in matlab lib (todo: audit)
# - mysql reconnnect?
# - enforcing uniqueness? e.g. mouse_id autoincrement with unique mouse name
#   ... appending 'unique' actually works.. so codify/document?
# - IntegrityError: document pymysql.err.IntegrityError as class
# - when python restart is *really* required?2
# - why '_experiment_data' tablename?
# - decorator / classdef triggers db connect/mktable -
#   e.g. schema is obj which connects, @schema refers to obj
#   separate init/setup method; implies settings need to be in place at
#   import time rather than runtime
